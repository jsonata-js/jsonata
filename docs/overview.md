## Introduction

JSONata is a lightweight query and transformation language for JSON data. Inspired by the 'location path' semantics of XPath 3.1, it allows sophisticated queries to be expressed in a compact and intuitive notation.  A rich complement of built in operators and functions is provided for manipulating and combining extracted data, and the results of queries can be formatted into any JSON output structure using familiar JSON object and array syntax. Coupled with the facility to create user defined functions, advanced expressions can be built to tackle any JSON query and transformation task.
