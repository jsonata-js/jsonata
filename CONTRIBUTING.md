### Legal stuff

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the same approach&mdash;the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](DCO1.1.txt)&mdash;that the Linux&reg; Kernel [community](http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin) uses to manage code contributions. We simply ask that when submitting a pull request, the developer must include a sign-off statement in the pull request description.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@hisdomain.com>
```

### Coding standards

Please ensure you follow the coding standards used through-out the existing code base. Coding standards are checked by ESLint. 100% test coverage must be maintained at all times. Run the following command to check coding rules and test coverage:

 - npm t
