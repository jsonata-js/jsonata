#### 1.4.1 Maintenance Release

- Object transformation syntax should work with arrays of objects as well as objects (issue #94)

#### 1.4.0 Milestone Release

- New object transformation syntax `~> |...|...|` (issue #70)
- New functions
  - $formatNumber - formats a decimal number to a string using a picture specification defined in XPath F&O spec (issue #54)
  - $formatBase - converts a number to a string in a specified radix
  - $pad - pads a string to a minimum width with leading or trailing padding characters
  - $toMillis - converts an ISO 8601 formatted date/time string to number of milliseconds since the epoch (issue #55)
  - $fromMillis - converts the number of milliseconds since the epoch to an ISO 8601 formatted date/time string (issue #55)
  - $clone - returns a deep copy of an object - used internally by the object transform syntax; overridable by custom implementation (issue #70)

#### 1.3.3 Maintenance Release

- $lookup() function throws an error when the property has a null value (issue #85)

#### 1.3.2 Maintenance Release

- Support extension functions that mix sync/async behaviours (issue #77)

#### 1.3.1 Maintenance Release

- Fix S0202 error insert to report token value, not token type (PR #74)
- Remove use of array iterators because they were failing to transpile to ES5 correctly (issue #78)

#### 1.3.0 Milestone Release

- Property names containing reserved tokens can now be quoted using backticks (`).  The current quoting mechanism using single or double quotes is deprecated and will probably be removed in a future major (e.g. v2.0.0) release.
- The parser can be invoked in a *robust* mode whereby errors will be indicated by an error token in the parse tree rather than throwing an exception. This is the first step in creating a parser that can recover and report multiple errors.  The default mode remains to throw an exception on first syntax error.
- New functions
  - $merge - merge an array of objects into a single object
  - $millis - current timestamp in milliseconds since the epoch

- Correctly handle null values when executed with a callback (#53)

#### 1.2.1 Maintenance Release

- Generate ES5 compatible version of jsonata.js (jsonata-es5.js & jsonata-es5.min.js) using Babel

- New functions $base64encode & base64decode
- Fix formatting of inserts in error messages
